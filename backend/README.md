# TaskBuddy Backend

REST API for **TaskBuddy**, a Philippine home-services marketplace: **clients**
post jobs in five categories (Plumbing, Cleaning, Handyman, Manicure, Pedicure)
and **providers** apply to them. If nobody is hired before the job's urgency
timeout, an ML **recommendation engine** scores eligible providers and invites
the best matches.

The full data-schema and product spec lives in [`BACKEND_SCHEMA.md`](./BACKEND_SCHEMA.md)
— that document is the source of truth for tables, lifecycle rules, and ML features.

> **🚀 Deployed instance:** the backend is live at
> **https://taskbuddy-kpek.onrender.com** — frontend developers can build
> against it directly, no local backend setup required (see
> [Base URL](#base-url) below). Status page: <https://taskbuddy-kpek.onrender.com/> ·
> JSON health: <https://taskbuddy-kpek.onrender.com/health>

## Architecture

```
mobile / web ──REST──► backend/ (NestJS, :3000)
                          │  verifies Supabase JWTs
                          │  reads/writes Postgres via service-role key
                          │  cron (every minute): urgency-timeout poller
                          ▼
                     Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)
                          ▲
                          │  POST /score (14 features per pair → probabilities)
                     ml-service/ (FastAPI — Random Forest rf-a-v1)
```

- **Supabase** provides Postgres (schema, triggers, RLS) and Auth (signup/login → JWTs).
- **NestJS** is the only thing the frontends talk to (besides token refresh, which
  also goes through it). It enforces authorization in code and owns all DB writes.
- **ml-service** is a stateless scorer serving the trained **Random Forest
  `rf-a-v1`** (0.82 accuracy / 0.88 ROC-AUC holdout). Deployed at
  <https://taskbuddy-ml-service-8ppc.onrender.com> — see
  [`../ml-service/README.md`](../ml-service/README.md).

### The matching flow

1. Client posts a job (`urgency`: urgent / normal / flexible).
2. Providers browse and apply organically; the client accepts **exactly one**.
3. If nobody is accepted before the urgency timeout (**5 / 10 / 15 min**), the
   scheduler moves the job to `recommending`, computes 14 ML features per eligible
   provider (SQL function `fn_job_provider_features`), scores them via ml-service,
   stores the ranked results, and notifies the **top 8** providers.
4. Recommended providers apply like anyone else; the client still picks one.
5. Job proceeds `assigned → in_progress → completed`, then the client leaves a
   review. Every scored candidate is labeled (`was_hired`) for future retraining.

Job lifecycle: `open → recommending → assigned → in_progress → completed`
(plus `cancelled` from any pre-completion state, and `expired` after 24 h unassigned).

## Setup

> Building a frontend? You can skip this whole section and use the
> [deployed instance](#base-url). Local setup is only needed when working on
> the backend itself.

### 1. Supabase project

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Apply **every** migration in [`supabase/migrations/`](./supabase/migrations) **in order**
   (0001 → 0029), either by pasting each file into the SQL Editor or with the CLI:

   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
   supabase db push
   ```

   | File | Contents |
   |---|---|
   | `0001_enums_and_tables.sql` | enums, all 11 tables, indexes |
   | `0002_functions_and_triggers.sql` | signup trigger, lifecycle triggers, cached-stat triggers, `haversine_km`, `fn_job_provider_features` |
   | `0003_rls.sql` | Row Level Security policies |
   | `0004_seed.sql` | 5 categories + urgency timeouts |
   | `0005_admin_role.sql` | adds `'admin'` to `user_role` enum + `admin_user_overview` view (profiles ⋈ `auth.users` email, service-role only) for the Admin Dashboard (#29/#31/#32). Admins can't self-register — promote a user manually after this migration (see the comment at the end of the file). |
   | `0006_wallet_chat_calendar.sql` | app-support subsystems (`wallet_transactions`, `conversations` + `messages`, `bookings`) backing the mobile Wallet/Chat/Calendar screens. Additive; not part of the ML flow. See `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §15. |
   | `0007_job_pricing_schedule_photos.sql` | `jobs.budget`, `jobs.scheduled_at`, `jobs.photo_urls`; creates the public `job-photos` Storage bucket; extends `handle_application_accepted()` to auto-create the `bookings` row. See `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §16. |
   | `0008_provider_verifications.sql` | `provider_verifications` + `provider_profiles.is_verified`; creates the **private** `verification-docs` Storage bucket. Backs the admin Verification queue. See `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §17. |
   | `0009_escrow_and_disputes.sql` | `escrow_transactions` + `disputes`. Backs the admin Transactions page and the mobile dispute screen. See `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §18. |
   | `0010_wallet_txn_kind.sql` | `wallet_transactions.kind`, so platform revenue counts payouts without also counting escrow refunds. Split out of 0009 because that file had already been applied. Safely re-runnable. |
   | `0011_avatars_and_user_settings.sql` | public `avatars` Storage bucket plus per-user notification and display settings. |
   | `0012_push_device_tokens.sql` | Expo push-device tokens and notification delivery metadata. |
   | `0013_stripe_payments_and_identity.sql` | Stripe PaymentIntent/Checkout idempotency and provider Stripe Identity verification support. |
   | `0014_admin_console_followups.sql` | timed suspensions, `admin_actions`, and expanded admin-console data. |
   | `0015_signup_consents_and_sp_category.sql` | signup consent records and provider service-category support. |
   | `0016_google_signup_pending.sql` | pending-profile state for Google signups. |
   | `0017_maintenance_mode.sql` | platform maintenance setting and wallet-ledger admin support. |
   | `0018_job_confirmed_status.sql` | `confirmed` job status and assignment lifecycle updates. |
   | `0019_job_tasks_and_verification_storage_rls.sql` | job checklists and verification-storage RLS policies. |
   | `0020_admin_search_functions.sql` | service-role-only SQL RPCs for paginated admin booking, activity, and escrow search. |
   | `0021_recovery_credit_kind.sql` | adds `'recovery_credit'` to `wallet_txn_kind`, the tag an admin-issued trust credit carries (`POST /admin/wallet-transactions/recovery-credit`, `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §28.1). Safely re-runnable. |
   | `0022_notification_announcement_type.sql` | `notification_type` gains `'announcement'` (admin broadcast) and `'wallet_update'` (withdrawal settled/declined). |
   | `0023_account_deletion_and_email_otp.sql` | `profiles.deleted_at` (soft delete) and `profiles.email_verified_at`; `admin_user_overview` re-created to expose `deleted_at`. |
   | `0024_withdrawal_requests_and_commission.sql` | withdrawal review columns on `wallet_transactions`, `platform_settings.commission_rate` (default 0), `escrow_transactions.commission_amount`. |
   | `0025_scheduler_cron.sql` | Postgres-driven scheduler ticks (pg_cron + pg_net) calling `POST /internal/tick/*`, so push and recommendation sweeps run while the API host sleeps. Read its header before applying — it needs a setup snippet run first. |
   | `0026_rls_write_lockdown.sql` | drops every RLS **write** policy 0003/0006/0019 granted to signed-in users (own profile, own provider row — including `is_verified` — jobs, application status, reviews, messages, checklist, notification read-state). All writes go through the API; reads are unchanged. See `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §11 and §17. Re-runnable. |
   | `0027_connect_transfer_kind.sql` | adds `'connect_transfer'` to `wallet_txn_kind`. **Apply alone and let it commit before 0028**, which names the value in an index. |
   | `0028_stripe_connect_and_card_funding.sql` | `provider_payout_accounts` (Connect Express, service-role writes only); escrow funding (`wallet`/`card`) and onward-transfer columns; `wallet_transactions.stripe_transfer_id`; and the service-role-only SQL functions `escrow_place_hold`, `escrow_settle`, `wallet_reserve_connect_transfer` that change escrow and write its ledger row in **one** transaction. See `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §29. Re-runnable. |
   | `0029_payments_tick_cron.sql` | schedules the payments sweep (`/internal/tick/payments`, every 5 min) through 0025's `scheduler_tick`. Does nothing, with a notice, where pg_cron or 0025 is absent. Re-runnable. |

   > Migrations 0008 and 0009 each run `alter type notification_type add value`.
   > Postgres allows this inside a transaction as long as the new value isn't
   > *used* in the same transaction — neither file inserts a notification, so
   > applying each file in one go is safe.

   > **0018 and 0019 must be applied as two separate runs.** 0018 adds
   > `'confirmed'` to the `job_status` enum and 0019 *uses* that value in a
   > CHECK constraint, which the same rule forbids inside one transaction (and
   > the Supabase SQL editor runs a pasted script as one transaction). Run
   > 0018, let it commit, then run 0019. `supabase db push` applies each file
   > in its own transaction and needs no special handling. Apply **0020 only
   > after 0019**: it depends on the complete jobs, escrow, and admin schema
   > established by the preceding migrations. 0021 has no such ordering
   > requirement — it's a standalone enum addition — but comes last since
   > it's the most recently added.
   >
   > The API code that ships with these migrations reads `job_tasks` on every
   > job query, so **apply 0019 before deploying the API**. Out of order, job
   > endpoints fail with PostgREST's "Could not find a relationship between
   > 'jobs' and 'job_tasks'".

   > **0022 must be applied on its own, before 0023 and 0024**, for the same
   > reason 0018 must precede 0019: it adds `notification_type` values that the
   > API writes immediately, and Postgres will not let a new enum value be used
   > in the transaction that added it. Run 0022, let it commit, then the other
   > two. `supabase db push` handles this itself.
   >
   > The API also reads `reviews` on every job query (the `has_review` flag) and
   > `platform_settings.commission_rate` on every escrow release, so **apply
   > 0023 and 0024 before deploying the API**. 0024's default commission rate is
   > 0, so applying it changes no payout until an admin sets a rate.

   The two Storage buckets are created by the migrations themselves
   (`insert into storage.buckets ... on conflict do nothing`), so there is no
   separate dashboard step. `job-photos` is public-read; `verification-docs`
   is private and is only ever read through short-lived signed URLs the API
   generates for admins.

3. (Development) In Authentication → Providers → Email, consider disabling
   "Confirm email" so `POST /auth/register` returns a session immediately.

### 2. API

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env    # fill in your Supabase URL + keys (Settings → API)
npm install
npm run start:dev       # http://localhost:3000
```

`WEB_CORS_ORIGINS` is a comma-separated allowlist for credentialed browser
requests. Set it explicitly in every externally deployed API environment and
include the exact admin-console origin; do not use `*`, because browser-admin
sessions require `credentials: 'include'`.

```env
WEB_CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-admin.example.com,http://localhost:3000
```

`TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` says how many proxies sit in front of the API; it defaults
to `1`, which is right on Render. It exists for the rate limiter: without it
every request behind the proxy arrives from the same address, the limiter sees
the whole platform as one client, and one abusive caller locks everybody out.
Set it to `0` only when the API is exposed directly — the value is also what
stops a client's own `X-Forwarded-For` from being a way around the limit.

### External deployment checklist

The repository contains the implementation, but an operator must still run
these external steps. This checklist does not assert that a deployment occurred.

1. Apply every migration in order, through the latest. Run 0018 and 0019 in
   separate SQL Editor transactions as described above, and 0022 on its own
   before 0023/0024; 0020 comes after 0019 and creates the service-role-only
   admin list RPCs. 0026 can run any time after 0025 — the API writes with the
   service-role key and is unaffected by it.
2. Set the API host's `WEB_CORS_ORIGINS`, then deploy the backend with the
   current environment variables and migrations available.
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` at the web host to that API's HTTPS origin and
   deploy the web application. Its origin must exactly match the CORS allowlist.
4. For mobile push, use a physical device to grant notification permission and
   register an Expo token after sign-in. Configure Expo/EAS credentials and,
   when Expo push security is enabled, set `EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN` on the API host.
5. Run the smoke checks in
   [`docs/backend-handoff-booking-tasks-verification.md`](../docs/backend-handoff-booking-tasks-verification.md).

### 3. ML service

```bash
cd ml-service
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows (source .venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

The committed model artifact (`ml-service/model/rf-a-v1.joblib`) is served as-is
— no training step needed. The API works without the service running, but
recommendation runs will fail until it's up (jobs still reach `recommending`;
use the manual trigger endpoint to retry). Full details:
[`../ml-service/README.md`](../ml-service/README.md).

## For frontend developers

### Base URL

| Environment | Base URL |
|---|---|
| **Production (Render)** | `https://taskbuddy-kpek.onrender.com` |
| Local development | `http://localhost:3000` |

Don't hardcode the URL — read it from an environment variable so it can be
switched per environment:

- **web (Next.js):** put `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://taskbuddy-kpek.onrender.com`
  in `web/.env.local` and use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
- **mobile (Expo):** put `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://taskbuddy-kpek.onrender.com`
  in `mobile/.env` and use `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

> **Free-tier note:** the Render instance spins down after ~15 minutes without
> traffic; the first request after that takes 30–60 s to answer (cold start).
> If a request seems to hang, wait — it's waking up, not broken. Check
> <https://taskbuddy-kpek.onrender.com/health> if unsure.

### Authentication

1. `POST /auth/register` with `{ email, password, role, full_name }` — `role` is
   `"client"` or `"provider"` and **cannot change later**. A DB trigger creates the
   profile automatically.
2. `POST /auth/login` returns `{ session: { access_token, refresh_token, expires_at } }`.
3. Send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` on every other request.
4. When the token expires, `POST /auth/refresh` with `{ refresh_token }`.

Providers must additionally set up their provider profile
(`PUT /profiles/me/provider`) before they can apply to jobs.

### Endpoint reference

All bodies are JSON. 🔒 = requires auth; (client) / (provider) = role-restricted.

**Auth**

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /auth/register` | `{ email, password, role, full_name, phone? }` |
| `POST /auth/login` | `{ email, password }` → `{ user: { id, email, full_name, role }, session }` |
| `POST /auth/admin/login` | admin-only browser login; sets httpOnly access/refresh cookies plus a readable CSRF cookie, returns minimal admin identity + `csrf_token` |
| `POST /auth/admin/refresh` | rotates browser-admin cookies; requires the refresh cookie and matching `X-CSRF-Token` |
| `GET /auth/admin/session` | current cookie-authenticated admin identity + `csrf_token` |
| `POST /auth/admin/logout` | revokes the current cookie-authenticated admin session and clears its cookies |
| `POST /auth/refresh` | `{ refresh_token }` → new session |
| `POST /auth/logout` 🔒 | revoke the session |
| `GET /auth/me` 🔒 | `{ profile, provider_profile }` |
| `POST /auth/change-password` 🔒 | `{ current_password, new_password }` — re-authenticates first |
| `POST /auth/forgot-password` | `{ email }` → mails a 6-digit code. **Always** `{ success: true }`, even for an unknown address — otherwise it's an email-enumeration oracle |
| `POST /auth/reset-password` | `{ email, token, new_password }` → `{ session }`. Needs the Supabase template to emit `{{ .Token }}` — see [`docs/password-reset-setup.md`](../docs/password-reset-setup.md) |
| `POST /auth/send-email-otp` | `{ email }` → mails the signup confirmation code. **Always** `{ success: true }` — same enumeration reasoning as forgot-password |
| `POST /auth/verify-email-otp` | `{ email, token }` → `{ user, session }`. Confirms the address with Supabase Auth and stamps `profiles.email_verified_at`. Needs the **Confirm signup** template to emit `{{ .Token }}` — see [`docs/email-otp-setup.md`](../docs/email-otp-setup.md) |

**Profiles & providers**

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `PATCH /profiles/me` 🔒 | update `full_name, phone, avatar_url, address, city, latitude, longitude`. `avatar_url` takes either an `avatars` Storage path (converted to a public URL) or an `https://` URL; `""` clears it |
| `PUT /profiles/me/provider` 🔒 (provider) | `{ category_id, bio (20–400 chars), years_experience?, service_radius_km? }` |
| `PATCH /profiles/me/provider/availability` 🔒 (provider) | `{ is_available: boolean }` |
| `DELETE /profiles/me` 🔒 | self-serve account deletion → `204`, or `409 { blockers[] }` while the account still has a balance, a pending withdrawal, escrow held, an open dispute, or a live job. A **soft** delete: the row survives (the ledger, reviews and ML snapshots reference it) with every identifying field scrubbed, and the Auth user is renamed, banned and signed out (migration 0023, `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §27.1) |
| `GET /providers/:id` 🔒 | public provider card (bio, category, rating, completed jobs) |
| `GET /providers/:id/reviews` 🔒 | reviews for a provider |
| `GET /categories` 🔒 | `[{ id, name }]` |

**Jobs**

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /jobs` 🔒 (client) | `{ category_id, title (5–120), description (20–750), urgency?, address, latitude, longitude, budget?, scheduled_at?, photo_urls?, tasks? }` — `scheduled_at` in the past is a 400; `tasks` is up to 20 checklist labels (≤120 chars each) stored as `job_tasks` |
| `GET /jobs?category_id=&limit=&offset=&latitude=&longitude=&radius_km=` 🔒 (provider) | browse `open`/`recommending` jobs, sorted by urgency then distance/newest; `latitude`+`longitude` (both required together) filter to `radius_km` (default 50km) of the provider; returns `{ jobs, summary: { open_count, urgent_count, potential_payout } }` |
| `GET /jobs/mine` 🔒 (client) | own jobs |
| `GET /jobs/assigned` 🔒 (provider) | jobs assigned to me |
| `GET /jobs/:id` 🔒 | job detail |
| `POST /jobs/:id/cancel` 🔒 (client) | any pre-completion state → `cancelled` |
| `POST /jobs/:id/accept` 🔒 (provider) | accept an incoming booking request; `assigned` → `confirmed`, notifies the client (migration 0018) |
| `POST /jobs/:id/start` 🔒 (provider) | `assigned`/`confirmed` → `in_progress` |
| `POST /jobs/:id/decline` 🔒 (provider) | `{ reason (1–200) }` — assigned provider declines before starting; `assigned`/`confirmed` → `cancelled`, refunds escrow, notifies client |
| `PATCH /jobs/:id/tasks/:taskId` 🔒 (provider) | `{ is_done }` — assigned provider ticks a checklist item; allowed while `confirmed`/`in_progress`; returns the whole job (migration 0019) |
| `POST /jobs/:id/complete` 🔒 (client) | `in_progress` → `completed` |
| `POST /jobs/:id/recommendations/trigger` 🔒 (client) | manually re-run the recommendation engine |

**Applications**

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /jobs/:jobId/applications` 🔒 (provider) | `{ cover_message? (≤300) }` — one per job |
| `GET /jobs/:jobId/applications` 🔒 (client) | applicants for own job |
| `GET /applications/mine` 🔒 (provider) | my applications with job info |
| `POST /applications/:id/accept` 🔒 (client) | hire this provider — assigns the job, auto-rejects everyone else, and holds the budget in escrow (400 if the wallet can't cover it) |
| `POST /applications/:id/reject` 🔒 (client) | decline |
| `POST /applications/:id/withdraw` 🔒 (provider) | retract a pending application |

**Reviews & notifications**

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /jobs/:jobId/review` 🔒 (client) | `{ rating: 1–5, comment? (≤500) }` — once per completed job |
| `GET /notifications?unread=true` 🔒 | newest 50 |
| `GET /notifications/unread-count` 🔒 | `{ count }` — server-side count, not capped at 50 |
| `POST /notifications/:id/read` 🔒 | mark one read |
| `POST /notifications/read-all` 🔒 | mark all read |

**Wallet, Chat & Calendar** (🔒 — app-support subsystems, migration 0006)

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /wallet` 🔒 | `{ balance, available, total_credited, total_debited, pending, pending_withdrawals, transactions[] }` — all derived from the ledger. `available` is `balance` less anything already promised to a pending withdrawal; that is the figure escrow checks before a hire |
| `POST /wallet/withdrawals` 🔒 | `{ amount, destination, title? }` → a **pending** ledger row. Nothing moves until an admin settles it — there is no payout rail, so the admin queue *is* the disbursement mechanism (migration 0024, `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §27.2) |
| `GET /wallet/withdrawals` 🔒 | the caller's own requests, newest first |
| `POST /wallet/withdrawals/:id/cancel` 🔒 | retract a request an admin has not acted on |
| `POST /wallet/transactions` 🔒 | **Deprecated** — use `POST /wallet/withdrawals`. Still accepts `{ direction: 'debit', amount, title, job_id?, destination? }` and now files the same pending request. `direction: 'credit'` is refused for **every** caller, admins included: wallet funding has exactly one entry point, a settled Stripe charge. The one deliberate exception lives on the admin surface — `POST /admin/wallet-transactions/recovery-credit` |
| `GET /conversations` 🔒 | caller's conversations (counterpart name + last-message time) |
| `POST /conversations` 🔒 | get-or-create for `{ job_id }` — job must have an assigned provider |
| `GET /conversations/:id/messages` 🔒 | messages, oldest first |
| `POST /conversations/:id/messages` 🔒 | send `{ body (1–1000) }` |
| `POST /conversations/:id/read` 🔒 | mark the other participant's messages read |
| `GET /conversations/:id/stream?since=` 🔒 | **SSE.** `message` events carrying a full message row, plus `ping` keep-alives. `since` = `created_at` of the newest message the client already has. Needs a client that sends an `Authorization` header — browser `EventSource` cannot |
| `GET /calendar/bookings?from=&to=` 🔒 | caller's bookings (provider or client side), with job + counterpart |
| `POST /calendar/bookings` 🔒 (provider) | `{ job_id, scheduled_at, duration_minutes?, notes? }` — schedule an assigned job |
| `PATCH /calendar/bookings/:id` 🔒 (provider) | `{ scheduled_at?, duration_minutes?, status?, notes? }` |

**Uploads** (🔒 — migration 0007/0008)

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /uploads/signed-url` 🔒 | `{ bucket: 'job-photos' \| 'verification-docs' \| 'avatars', content_type }` → `{ bucket, path, upload_url, token }` |

The object path is generated **server-side** as `<profile id>/<uuid>.<ext>` — a
client-supplied path would let one user overwrite another's ID documents. Upload
the file straight to `upload_url` with a `PUT`, then send the returned `path`
(not a URL) to `POST /jobs` or `POST /verifications`. Only `image/jpeg`,
`image/png` and `image/webp` are accepted, and `verification-docs` is
provider-only. Bytes never pass through the API — the Render free tier would
have to buffer every image.

**Verifications** (migration 0008)

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /verifications` 🔒 (provider) | `{ id_document_path, selfie_path }` — 400 if one is already pending, or if either upload fails the pre-check (missing/zero-byte/non-image object; migration 0014) |
| `POST /verifications/identity-session` 🔒 (provider) | starts a **Stripe Identity** session instead → `{ verification, session_id, ephemeral_key_secret, url, publishable_key }`. Documents go to Stripe and never reach this server; the result arrives by webhook, so poll `GET /verifications/me` |
| `GET /verifications/me` 🔒 (provider) | latest submission + status |

Two routes, one queue: a `manual` row carries document paths and waits for an
admin, a `stripe_identity` row carries none and is resolved by webhook. Only one
review may be open per provider, whichever route it came in by.

Approval flips `provider_profiles.is_verified`, and that flag is a **gate**,
not a badge (`BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §17). An unverified provider can browse the
feed but:

- `POST /jobs/:jobId/applications` answers `403 { message: 'Verify your identity
  before applying to jobs', code: 'verification_required' }`;
- `POST /applications/:id/accept` answers `409 { code: 'provider_not_verified' }`
  before any money is held, in case an application outlives the verification
  it was filed under.

The `code` is what the app branches on to offer a way to verify. Since
migration 0026 no signed-in user can write `provider_profiles` directly, so
the flag can only be set by an approval or a Stripe Identity webhook.

**Disputes** (migration 0009)

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /jobs/:jobId/disputes` 🔒 (client) | `{ reason (1–200), details? (≤1000) }` — the job's escrow must still be `held` |
| `GET /jobs/:jobId/disputes` 🔒 | the job's latest dispute (client or assigned provider) |

**Settings** (🔒 — migration 0011)

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /settings` 🔒 | `{ push_enabled, email_enabled, sms_enabled, location_sharing, dark_mode }` — creates the row with DDL defaults on first read |
| `PATCH /settings` 🔒 | any subset of those five booleans; upserts, so a toggle works before any read |

Only `push_enabled` is enforced today. The email and SMS flags are stored so the
screen round-trips honestly; no transport reads them yet.

**Push notifications** (🔒 — migration 0012)

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /devices` 🔒 | `{ token: 'ExponentPushToken[...]', platform: ios/android/web }` — upserts on `token`, so a handset that changes hands follows its new owner |
| `DELETE /devices/:token` 🔒 | unregister on sign-out. Scoped to the caller's own rows |

Delivery is a 30-second `@Cron` sweep of `notifications` where `pushed_at is
null`, filtered by each recipient's `push_enabled`. Best-effort: `notifications`
stays the source of truth, and a push that never lands costs a banner, not a
record. Tokens Expo rejects as `DeviceNotRegistered` are deleted.

**Payments** (migration 0013 — [`docs/stripe-setup.md`](../docs/stripe-setup.md))

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /payments/config` 🔒 | `{ publishable_key }` — served rather than compiled in, so test↔live is a backend env change |
| `POST /payments/topup` 🔒 | `{ amount }` (₱20–₱100,000) → PaymentSheet parameters: `{ payment_intent_client_secret, ephemeral_key_secret, customer_id, publishable_key, amount, currency }` |
| `POST /payments/checkout-session` 🔒 | `{ amount, app_redirect }` → `{ url, session_id, amount }`. Hosted Checkout, for clients that cannot load a native SDK — **this is what the Expo Go app uses** |
| `POST /payments/hire-checkout-session` 🔒 (client) | `{ application_id, app_redirect }` → `{ url, session_id, amount }`. **Card-at-hire**: Checkout for the job's full budget. The hire itself is made by the webhook (credit → hold → accept), not by this call — poll the application afterwards. Same hireability checks as a wallet accept; 400 `card_amount_out_of_range` outside ₱20–₱100,000. `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §29.4 |
| `GET /payments/return?status=&app_redirect=&flow=` | Where Stripe returns the browser. Redirects to the app deep link with `?topup=success\|cancelled`, or `?hire=…` when `flow=hire`. No JWT — it is a plain browser navigation that reveals and changes nothing |
| `POST /payments/webhook` | Stripe only. No JWT — authenticated by the signature over the **raw** body |

**The wallet is credited by the webhook, never by `POST /payments/topup`, and
never by the browser returning from Checkout.** Those only open the payment UI;
a client that reported its own success could mint balance, and balance buys
labour through escrow. Refresh `GET /wallet` afterwards — on a slow webhook the
balance can lag a second or two.

Both routes converge on one handler: the Checkout session puts the payer
identity in `payment_intent_data.metadata`, so `payment_intent.succeeded`
credits the wallet whether the charge came from PaymentSheet or Checkout. No
second handler, and no extra Dashboard subscription.

`app_redirect` is checked against the same allowlist as the Google OAuth flow
(`isAllowedAppRedirect`) at both session creation and return. Stripe accepts
only http(s) in `success_url`, which is the whole reason `/payments/return`
exists — and without that check it would be an open redirect.

`GET /payments/return` builds its URLs from `PUBLIC_API_URL`, falling back to
the request's host and `x-forwarded-proto`. On Render TLS terminates at the
proxy, so the raw protocol would be `http` and users would be bounced out of
TLS mid-payment.

Redelivery is safe: `wallet_transactions.stripe_payment_intent_id` is
partial-unique and the collision *is* the idempotency check. Without Stripe env
vars these endpoints return **503** and the rest of the API is unaffected.

**Provider payouts — Stripe Connect Express** (migrations 0027–0028, `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §29, setup in [`docs/stripe-setup.md`](../docs/stripe-setup.md) §6)

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /payments/connect` 🔒 (provider) | `{ state: 'not_started' \| 'onboarding' \| 'restricted' \| 'active', details_submitted, payouts_enabled, transfers_active, requirements_due[], disabled_reason, country }`. The Stripe account id is never returned |
| `POST /payments/connect/onboarding-link` 🔒 (provider) | `{ app_redirect }` → `{ url, expires_at }`. Creates the provider's Express account on first use (transfers capability only), then a single-use Stripe onboarding link |
| `POST /payments/connect/sync` 🔒 (provider) | Re-reads the account from Stripe → the same status shape. The app calls it on returning from onboarding, since reaching `return` does not mean the form was finished |
| `POST /payments/connect/dashboard-link` 🔒 (provider) | `{ url }` — a one-time login to the provider's Stripe Express dashboard (bank details, payout history). 400 until onboarding has been submitted |
| `GET /payments/connect/return?app_redirect=` · `GET /payments/connect/refresh?app_redirect=` | Stripe's `return_url` / `refresh_url`. Redirect to the app with `?connect=return\|refresh`; allowlisted like `/payments/return` |
| `POST /payments/connect/webhook` | Stripe only, a **separate** endpoint with its own secret (`STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`). `account.updated` / `capability.updated` re-read the account and store what Stripe says now |

**Card-funded payouts** are sent on to the provider's Connect account automatically when the escrow
is released — a transfer sourced from the job's own charge, so Stripe's own FX rate applies
(`BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §29.5). Wallet-funded payouts, and providers without an active account, stay in
the wallet and withdraw through the manual queue.

The three `POST` routes carry the payments rate limit. Connect is optional: without
`STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` the webhook answers 503 and statuses update only on sync.

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | — | Signing secret of the Connect webhook endpoint |
| `STRIPE_CONNECT_COUNTRY` | `US` | Country for new Express accounts |
| `STRIPE_CONNECT_SERVICE_AGREEMENT` | `full` | `recipient` for cross-border accounts (e.g. PH on a US platform), once Stripe has enabled that |

**Admin** (🔒 admin role only — 401 without a token, 403 for non-admins)

| Method & path | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /admin/users?search=&role=&status=&limit=&offset=` | search/filter users (`role`: client/provider/admin, `status`: active/suspended/**deleted**). Deleted accounts are excluded unless asked for, and never appear under `suspended` (migration 0023) |
| `GET /admin/users/:id` | single user detail (from `admin_user_overview`) |
| `POST /admin/users/:id/suspend` | `{ duration_days?, reason }` — refuses if already suspended or if the target is an admin. Omit `duration_days` for indefinite; otherwise the suspension lifts itself the next time `deactivated_at` is checked (login), no cron job |
| `POST /admin/users/:id/reinstate` | reactivate a suspended account |
| `POST /admin/users/:id/send-password-reset` | admin-triggered password reset email — refuses admin targets (migration 0014) |
| `GET /admin/bookings?search=&status=&category_id=&limit=&offset=` | platform-wide bookings view; search matches booking ID, client/provider name, or service category (story #31) |
| `GET /admin/bookings/:id` | one booking's full detail, plus its escrow record if one exists; stored `job-photos` paths are returned as public photo URLs |
| `POST /admin/bookings/:id/cancel` | force-cancel a booking — refuses if already `completed`/`cancelled`/`expired` |
| `GET /admin/analytics/summary` | totals (users/clients/providers/suspended/bookings/avg_rating/revenue/**commission**/`pending_verifications`/`pending_withdrawals`), bookings by status/category, daily booking trend, revenue trend, commission trend, top 10 providers by completed jobs (story #32). `total_revenue` is what flowed *through* the platform; `total_commission` is what it *kept* — see `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §27.5 |
| `GET /admin/activity?search=&limit=&offset=&from=&to=` | job-status transitions; search matches job title → `{ items, total }` (migration 0014 — was a bare array of the newest 20) |
| `GET /admin/audit?action=&actor_id=&from=&to=&limit=&offset=` | the admin action audit trail → `{ actions, total }` (migration 0014) — see below |
| `GET /admin/jobs/:jobId/conversation` | read-only view of a job's chat, oldest first, for dispute review (migration 0014) |
| `GET /admin/verifications?status=&limit=&offset=` | review queue; rows carry provider name, email, and short-lived signed document URLs |
| `POST /admin/verifications/:id/approve` | approve → sets `provider_profiles.is_verified` |
| `POST /admin/verifications/:id/reject` | `{ reason? }` |
| `GET /admin/transactions?search=&status=&limit=&offset=` | escrow records with both parties + service name; search matches transaction ID, client/provider name, or job title (story #17/#18) |
| `GET /admin/disputes?status=&limit=&offset=` | dispute queue |
| `POST /admin/disputes/:id/resolve` | `{ resolution: 'released_to_provider' \| 'refunded_to_client', note? }` (story #20) |
| `POST /admin/wallet-transactions/recovery-credit` | `{ profile_id, amount, title, job_id? }` — issues a trust credit after a dispute, tagged `kind: 'recovery_credit'` (migration 0021). **The only route that adds balance outside a settled Stripe charge or an escrow release**, which is why it is admin-only and audited; `POST /wallet/transactions` still refuses credits from everyone. Refuses a deleted recipient, a `job_id` they are not on, and anything over ₱50,000. See `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §28.1 |
| `POST /admin/escrow/:id/retry-transfer` | retries a card-funded payout's Stripe transfer that `failed`, was `abandoned`, or was `not_eligible` → `{ outcome }`. Audited (`escrow.retry_transfer`). The money is in the provider's wallet either way (`BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §29.5) |
| `GET /admin/withdrawals?status=&limit=&offset=` | the settlement queue — `pending` by default, oldest first (migration 0024) |
| `POST /admin/withdrawals/:id/settle` | `{ reference? }` — records that the money was actually sent. This is what debits the wallet; the balance is re-checked first and the row is only settled once, whoever clicks |
| `POST /admin/withdrawals/:id/reject` | `{ reason }` — the reason reaches the account holder and the amount returns to their available balance |
| `GET /admin/categories` | every service category, active or not (`GET /categories` still serves the apps only active ones) |
| `POST /admin/categories` | `{ name }` — 409 on a duplicate name |
| `PATCH /admin/categories/:id` | `{ name?, is_active? }`. **No delete** — jobs, provider profiles and the ML feature set all reference a category by id; `is_active: false` takes it off the menu without rewriting history |
| `GET /admin/admins` | who currently holds admin |
| `POST /admin/admins` | `{ email, full_name }` — creates or promotes an admin. **No password is accepted**; the new admin sets their own from the reset email this sends |
| `POST /admin/admins/:id/revoke` | demote to `client`. Refuses self-demotion and refuses to remove the last admin |
| `POST /admin/notifications/broadcast` | `{ title, body, audience: 'all' \| 'clients' \| 'providers' }` → `{ sent, failed, audience }`. One row per recipient (so read state and push both work); excludes admins, suspended and deleted accounts |
| `GET /admin/commission` | the current platform cut |
| `PATCH /admin/commission` | `{ commission_rate }` — a **fraction**, 0.15 being 15%, capped at 0.5. Applies to escrow released from now on; settled jobs keep their figures (migration 0024) |

Admin accounts can't self-register (`POST /auth/register` only allows
`client`/`provider`). The admin console uses `POST /auth/admin/login` and the
cookie-session endpoints above; mobile and other bearer-token clients can use
the general login flow. See `0005_admin_role.sql` above for how to promote an
account to `admin`.

**Admin audit trail** (migration 0014, `admin_actions` table, service-role only
— never client-readable outside `GET /admin/audit`): every `suspend`,
`reinstate`, `bookings/:id/cancel`, verification `approve`/`reject`, and
dispute `resolve` writes a row (`actor_id`, `action` like `user.suspend`,
`target_type`, `target_id`, `metadata`). Distinct from `job_status_history`,
which audits job lifecycle transitions, not the admin behind a decision.

### Escrow, in one paragraph

The `wallet_transactions` ledger is the only account of record; Stripe decides
whether money arrived, the ledger records it. When a client accepts an
application on a job with a `budget`, the client is **debited** and an
`escrow_transactions` row is created as `held` — in one SQL transaction
(`escrow_place_hold`, migration 0028). A client can also **pay the hire by
card** (`POST /payments/hire-checkout-session`): Stripe's webhook credits the
payment, holds it and accepts the application (`BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §29.4). On completion it becomes `released` and the provider is **credited**.
Cancelling returns the money to the client; a dispute freezes it until an admin
resolves it either way (release → provider, refund → client).

Because a hold needs real funds, **`POST /applications/:id/accept` returns 400
`Insufficient wallet balance`** when the client can't cover the budget — the job
stays `open`. Clients top up through Stripe hosted Checkout
(`POST /payments/checkout-session`), and the wallet is credited when Stripe's
webhook reports the charge settled. That webhook is the **only** way money
enters: `POST /wallet/transactions` refuses `direction: 'credit'`, since anything
else would let any authenticated caller mint balance that buys real labour.

The balance the hold checks is the **available** one — settled, less anything
already promised to a pending withdrawal. Without that reservation a client could
file a withdrawal for their whole balance and hire someone with the same money;
whichever settled second would take the ledger negative.

Money leaves by request, not by ledger entry. `POST /wallet/withdrawals` files a
**pending** row and an admin settles it by hand from `GET /admin/withdrawals` —
there is no payout rail, so that queue *is* the disbursement mechanism
(`BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §27.2).

**Releasing raises rather than going quiet.** `EscrowService.release()` throws on
an escrow that does not exist or is no longer `held`; `releaseIfHeld()` — what the
job lifecycle calls — tolerates the two absences a normal completion legitimately
reaches it in (a job posted without a budget, and a disputed hold frozen for an
admin) and still raises on an already-released one. A silent no-op would let a
retried caller read success and believe a provider had been paid. §28.2.

**Hiring holds the money before it accepts the application.** The accept fires a
trigger that assigns the job and rejects every rival applicant, which application
code cannot reverse; an insufficient balance discovered afterwards used to leave a
hired provider standing behind an error the client read as a failure. Now the
refusal lands while the job is still `open`. §28.3.

Every ledger row carries a `kind`, and **`kind = 'payout'` is the gross value
that flowed through the platform**. This matters: a payout and a refund are both
credits with a `job_id`, so the old `direction + job_id` rule would have counted
refunds as revenue. `kind` is derived server-side and never read from the request
body — otherwise anyone could inflate the reported figure by topping up.

What the platform actually **keeps** is the commission: a fraction of the budget
withheld at release, frozen onto `escrow_transactions.commission_amount`. It has
no ledger row of its own, because `wallet_transactions` is keyed by profile and
the platform is not a profile. The rate defaults to 0, so nothing is withheld
until an admin sets one via `PATCH /admin/commission`. See `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md`
§18 — including the documented concurrency caveat on the balance check — and
§27.5.

### Rate limiting

Enforced by a global `ThrottlerGuard` (`BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §28.4). Over the
limit is a `429`.

**Every limit is per endpoint, per IP** — the throttler keys on handler + IP, so
each route counts separately and there is no aggregate cap across the API.

| Scope | Limit (per endpoint, per IP) |
|---|---|
| Everything | 240 / minute |
| `POST /payments/topup`, `POST /payments/checkout-session`, `POST /payments/hire-checkout-session` | 5 / minute |
| `POST /auth/{register,login,admin/login,forgot-password,reset-password,send-email-otp,verify-email-otp,change-password}` | 10 / minute **each** |
| `POST /payments/connect/{onboarding-link,sync,dashboard-link}` | 5 / minute each |
| `POST /payments/webhook`, `POST /payments/connect/webhook` | exempt — Stripe is authenticated by signature and retries for three days |

`POST /auth/refresh`, `GET /auth/me` and the admin session routes are
deliberately left on the 240 ceiling: they fire on ordinary app use, and a tight
limit there would sign people out rather than stop anything.

The 240 is a burst allowance, not a quota: a mobile screen that loads jobs,
wallet and an unread count on focus legitimately fires several requests at once.
The tight limits are the ones that matter — they stop the payment routes being a
free card-testing endpoint pointed at Stripe, and the auth routes being a
password-guessing or mail-relay surface. Neither stops a distributed attempt;
per-IP limiting cannot.

Storage is in-memory, so the limit is also **per process**. One Render instance
makes that the whole platform; a second would double every ceiling, and shared
storage (Redis) is the fix if it comes to that.

### Errors

Errors use NestJS's standard shape with proper status codes (400 validation,
401 bad/expired token, 403 wrong role/not owner, 404 not found):

```json
{ "statusCode": 400, "message": ["title must be longer than or equal to 5 characters"], "error": "Bad Request" }
```

### Example flow (curl)

```bash
API=https://taskbuddy-kpek.onrender.com   # or http://localhost:3000

# 1. Register + login as client
curl -X POST $API/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"client@test.com","password":"secret123","role":"client","full_name":"Ana Cruz"}'
TOKEN=$(curl -sX POST $API/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"client@test.com","password":"secret123"}' | jq -r .session.access_token)

# 2. Post a job
curl -X POST $API/jobs -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"category_id":1,"title":"Fix kitchen faucet","description":"Tumutulo yung gripo sa kusina, need ayusin agad po.","urgency":"urgent","address":"Quezon City","latitude":14.6760,"longitude":121.0437}'
```

## Recommendation engine

- A scheduler inside the API runs **every minute**: `open` jobs past their
  `recommendation_deadline` flip to `recommending` (at most once), get scored, and
  the top 8 providers receive `recommendation_invite` notifications.
- Feature vectors come from the `fn_job_provider_features(job_id)` SQL function —
  14 raw features per pair, names matching the ML training CSV exactly.
- Scoring is done by the trained **Random Forest `rf-a-v1`** in ml-service
  (`recommendation_runs.model_version` records which model produced each run).
- Every scored pair is snapshotted in `recommendation_candidates`; when the job
  closes, `was_hired` is backfilled, turning production data into retraining rows.
  Export query: see `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §13 — **exclude `model_version = 'stub-v0'`
  rows** (produced by the early placeholder scorer). Retraining/versioning guide:
  [`../ml-service/README.md`](../ml-service/README.md).

## Pending handoffs

- [`docs/backend-handoff-mobile-e2e-test-environment.md`](../docs/backend-handoff-mobile-e2e-test-environment.md) —
  **open, blocking**: the mobile e2e sweep needs a Google Maps API key (job creation crashes
  without one), a wallet balance seed for the test client account, and per-job
  `recommendation_deadline` SQL nudges. Needs Google Cloud Console + Supabase dashboard access,
  not a code change here beyond the one-line `app.json` config once a key exists.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run start:dev   # dev server with watch
npm run build       # compile
npm run lint        # eslint --fix
npm run format      # prettier
npm test            # jest unit + lifecycle specs (supabase-js mocked)
npm run test:sql    # the real migrations on real Postgres (PGlite, in-process)
```

`test:sql` applies every migration to PGlite (Postgres compiled to
WebAssembly — no server, no Docker) with the Supabase `auth`/`storage` schemas
stubbed, then exercises the money functions from 0028, the RLS lockdown from
0026, and re-applying the latest migrations. The jest suites mock the
database and cannot see SQL at all; this is what does. `0025` is skipped — it
needs pg_cron, pg_net and Vault.
