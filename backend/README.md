# TaskBuddy Backend

REST API for **TaskBuddy**, a Philippine home-services marketplace: **clients**
post jobs in five categories (Plumbing, Cleaning, Handyman, Manicure, Pedicure)
and **providers** apply to them. If nobody is hired before the job's urgency
timeout, an ML **recommendation engine** scores eligible providers and invites
the best matches.

The full data-schema and product spec lives in [`BACKEND_SCHEMA.md`](./BACKEND_SCHEMA.md)
— that document is the source of truth for tables, lifecycle rules, and ML features.

## Architecture

```
mobile / web ──REST──► backend/ (NestJS, :3000)
                          │  verifies Supabase JWTs
                          │  reads/writes Postgres via service-role key
                          │  cron (every minute): urgency-timeout poller
                          ▼
                     Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)
                          ▲
                          │  POST /score (14 features per pair → probabilities)
                     ml-service/ (FastAPI, :8000 — currently a stub)
```

- **Supabase** provides Postgres (schema, triggers, RLS) and Auth (signup/login → JWTs).
- **NestJS** is the only thing the frontends talk to (besides token refresh, which
  also goes through it). It enforces authorization in code and owns all DB writes.
- **ml-service** is a stateless scorer. It is currently a **placeholder**
  (`model_version: stub-v0`) — see [`../ml-service/README.md`](../ml-service/README.md).

### The matching flow

1. Client posts a job (`urgency`: urgent / normal / flexible).
2. Providers browse and apply organically; the client accepts **exactly one**.
3. If nobody is accepted before the urgency timeout (**5 / 10 / 15 min**), the
   scheduler moves the job to `recommending`, computes 14 ML features per eligible
   provider (SQL function `fn_job_provider_features`), scores them via ml-service,
   stores the ranked results, and notifies the **top 8** providers.
4. Recommended providers apply like anyone else; the client still picks one.
5. Job proceeds `assigned → in_progress → completed`, then the client leaves a
   review. Every scored candidate is labeled (`was_hired`) for future retraining.

Job lifecycle: `open → recommending → assigned → in_progress → completed`
(plus `cancelled` from any pre-completion state, and `expired` after 24 h unassigned).

## Setup

### 1. Supabase project

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Apply the migrations in [`supabase/migrations/`](./supabase/migrations) **in order**
   (0001 → 0004), either by pasting each file into the SQL Editor or with the CLI:

   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
   supabase db push
   ```

   | File | Contents |
   |---|---|
   | `0001_enums_and_tables.sql` | enums, all 11 tables, indexes |
   | `0002_functions_and_triggers.sql` | signup trigger, lifecycle triggers, cached-stat triggers, `haversine_km`, `fn_job_provider_features` |
   | `0003_rls.sql` | Row Level Security policies |
   | `0004_seed.sql` | 5 categories + urgency timeouts |

3. (Development) In Authentication → Providers → Email, consider disabling
   "Confirm email" so `POST /auth/register` returns a session immediately.

### 2. API

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env    # fill in your Supabase URL + keys (Settings → API)
npm install
npm run start:dev       # http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. ML service (stub)

```bash
cd ml-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

The API works without it, but recommendation runs will fail until it's up
(jobs still reach `recommending`; use the manual trigger endpoint to retry).

## For frontend developers

### Authentication

1. `POST /auth/register` with `{ email, password, role, full_name }` — `role` is
   `"client"` or `"provider"` and **cannot change later**. A DB trigger creates the
   profile automatically.
2. `POST /auth/login` returns `{ session: { access_token, refresh_token, expires_at } }`.
3. Send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` on every other request.
4. When the token expires, `POST /auth/refresh` with `{ refresh_token }`.

Providers must additionally set up their provider profile
(`PUT /profiles/me/provider`) before they can apply to jobs.

### Endpoint reference

All bodies are JSON. 🔒 = requires auth; (client) / (provider) = role-restricted.

**Auth**

### Errors

Errors use NestJS's standard shape with proper status codes (400 validation,
401 bad/expired token, 403 wrong role/not owner, 404 not found):

```json
{ "statusCode": 400, "message": ["title must be longer than or equal to 5 characters"], "error": "Bad Request" }
```

### Example flow (curl)

```bash
# 1. Register + login as client
curl -X POST localhost:3000/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"client@test.com","password":"secret123","role":"client","full_name":"Ana Cruz"}'
TOKEN=$(curl -sX POST localhost:3000/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"client@test.com","password":"secret123"}' | jq -r .session.access_token)

# 2. Post a job
curl -X POST localhost:3000/jobs -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"category_id":1,"title":"Fix kitchen faucet","description":"Tumutulo yung gripo sa kusina, need ayusin agad po.","urgency":"urgent","address":"Quezon City","latitude":14.6760,"longitude":121.0437}'
```

## Recommendation engine

- A scheduler inside the API runs **every minute**: `open` jobs past their
  `recommendation_deadline` flip to `recommending` (at most once), get scored, and
  the top 8 providers receive `recommendation_invite` notifications.
- Feature vectors come from the `fn_job_provider_features(job_id)` SQL function —
  14 raw features per pair, names matching the ML training CSV exactly.
- Every scored pair is snapshotted in `recommendation_candidates`; when the job
  closes, `was_hired` is backfilled, turning production data into retraining rows.
  Export query: see `BACKEND_SCHEMA.md` §13 (exclude `model_version = 'stub-v0'` runs).
- The scorer is currently a **placeholder** — swap-in instructions are in
  [`../ml-service/README.md`](../ml-service/README.md).
